              Hi there! My name is Jason, and I'm working on becoming a
              full-stack developer. I've taken a few courses on Udemy, and I've
              built a few small-scale projects to make sure I understand what
              I've learned.

              I'm a dilligent worker, a self-starter, and a great teammate. I'm
              looking for a position that will allow me to have fun with my
              team, while delivering the highest quality product. I want to help
              millions of people!

            This course starts from a Hello, World, and builds through Object
            Oriented Programming. I used inheritance and polymorphism to create
            several silly little projects, and challenged myself at the end to
            make

            users to buy/sell those stocks into either a chequing or savings
            accounts. The stock price changes each "day" and the two accounts
            have different interest rates/penalties for selling

            This course takes a hands-on approach to learning data structures
            and algorithms. Beginning with arrays, you learn how to create
            structures for yourself, and use that to understand why each
            structure has the Big O notation that it does.

            This is a course that will be taught in Javascript and cover things
            like Node, Express, and databases. Instead of limiting myself to the
            back-end courses to complete just the databases, it made sense to
            switch to full-stack and learn both (as well as Javascript) at the
            same time.
